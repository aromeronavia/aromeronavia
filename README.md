### Welcome to my profile 👋

My name is Alberto Romero, as of Today (June 2021) I've been doing software engineering for 7+ years in corps and startups at Mexico and Silicon Valley. My last two years have been in leadership positions as Engineering Lead and Engineering Manager, but I have not lost focus on the code, I like to ship things and iterate fast. My strongest technologies are Node.js, Vue.js, Python, Ruby and React ⚛️.

Some of my projects here are:
- 🎄 [Advent of Code](https://github.com/beeetooo/advent-of-code): Just solving as many problems as I can in 2021 with Rust!
- 🎸 [Guitar Scale Modes](https://guitarscalemodes.com): Built a page to select a specific scale from modern music (Doryan, Aeolian, etc) to be painted in a fretboard with a base note! Contributions are welcome :)
- 🎰 [Rust Exercism](https://github.com/beeetooo/exercism-rust): Some algorithm exercises done in Rust just for the purpose of learning the language.
- 🚩 [Minesweeper](https://github.com/beeetooo/minesweeper): An adaptable minesweeper game that reuses the Minesweeper Core logic of the codebase between a Web UI and a Console UI, making the Presentation Layer an implementation detail. Done with **Node.js** primarily, added some [unit tests](https://github.com/beeetooo/minesweeper/tree/master/test) in case you want to take a look 👌
- 🕺 [Cumbio](https://beeetooo.github.io/cumbio/): Cumbia beat generator using **Javascript** Web Audio API 💃 ambitious vision is to convert any possible song into cumbia, including Metal Core and Progressive Post Hardcore (Wut!?)
- ✔️ [Aree Hiring](https://vigorous-euclid-2398c3.netlify.app/apply/1338cc67-f2ea-41ca-9c68-95d364b4c4ef): Been working on a Technical Pre-screening tool to speed up interviewing processes at companies. Using **Netlify**, **Firebase DB** and **Cloud Functions**, **Node.js** and **Nuxt.js (Vue)**
