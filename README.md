### Welcome to my profile 👋

My name is Alberto Romero, been doing software engineering for 7+ years in corps and startups at Mexico and Silicon Valley.

- 🍵 My last two years have been in leadership positions as Engineering Lead and Engineering Manager, but I have not lost focus on the code, I like to ship things and iterate fast.
- 🩹 My biggest weakness at the moment is Infrastructure, I have been too focused on the code aspect and I have always been surrounded by people handling that part 😅 I know some things of course but not on a deep level. That's one of my goals for 2021 of course 💪
- 🚀 My strongest technologies are Node.js, Vue.js, Python, Ruby and React ⚛️.
- 🗺️ I like a lot software design 📋 how to make sure pieces match correctly at a fast pace while having to deliver value at the same time. I have been working in fast-growing environments, trying to figure out the best trade offs for the company and the team in terms of the code.
- 🔄 I created a community of CTOs and Technical Leaders in Mexico called [Esquina CTO](https://www.esquinacto.com) where we talk about product management, processes, and of course tons of engineering!

Some of my projects here are:
- ✔️ [Aree Hiring](https://vigorous-euclid-2398c3.netlify.app/apply/1338cc67-f2ea-41ca-9c68-95d364b4c4ef): Been working on a Technical Pre-screening tool to speed up interviewing processes at companies. Using **Netlify**, **Firebase DB** and **Cloud Functions**, **Node.js** and **Nuxt.js (Vue)**
- 🚩 [Minesweeper](https://github.com/beeetooo/minesweeper): An adaptable minesweeper game that reuses the Minesweeper Core logic of the codebase between a Web UI and a Console UI, making the Presentation Layer an implementation detail. Done with **Node.js** primarily, added some [unit tests](https://github.com/beeetooo/minesweeper/tree/master/test) in case you want to take a look 👌
- 🕺 [Cumbio](https://beeetooo.github.io/cumbio/): Cumbia beat generator using **Javascript** Web Audio API 💃 ambitious vision is to convert any possible song into cumbia, including Metal Core and Progressive Post Hardcore (Wut!?)
