### Welcome to my profile 👋

My name is Alberto Romero, as of Today (January 2022) I've been doing software engineering for 7+ years in corps and startups at Mexico and Silicon Valley. My last two years have been in leadership positions as Engineering Lead and Engineering Manager, but I have not lost focus on the code, I like to ship things and iterate fast. My strongest technologies are Node.js, Vue.js, Python, Ruby and React ⚛️.
