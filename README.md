### Welcome to my profile 👋

My name is Alberto Romero, as of Today (January 2022) I've been doing software engineering for 7+ years in corps and startups at Mexico and Silicon Valley. My last two years have been in leadership positions as Engineering Lead and Engineering Manager, but I have not lost focus on the code, I like to ship things and iterate fast. My strongest technologies are Node.js, Vue.js, Python, Ruby and React ⚛️.

Some of my projects from 2021 are:
- 🗒️ [Aree Hiring](https://areehiring.com/apply/38dd989a-9c67-4f78-8ed8-255dd2107bb9): Meant to be a clone of [Toggl Hire](https://toggl.com/hire/). You can create an account by going [here](https://areehiring.com)
- 🎄 [Advent of Code](https://github.com/aromeronavia/advent-of-code): Just solving as many problems as I can in 2021 with Rust!
- 🎸 [Guitar Scale Modes](https://guitarscalemodes.com): Built a page to select a specific scale from modern music (Doryan, Aeolian, etc) to be painted in a fretboard with a base note! Contributions are welcome :)
- 🎰 [Rust Exercism](https://github.com/beeetooo/exercism-rust): Some algorithm exercises done in Rust just for the purpose of learning the language.
